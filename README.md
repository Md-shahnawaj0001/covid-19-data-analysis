Perfect 👍 since you want a **better, detailed, and professional `README.md`**, I’ll prepare one that explains your project like a **portfolio showcase**. This will make your GitHub repo attractive for recruiters, collaborators, or interviewers.

Here’s a polished version:

# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis with World Happiness Report

This project combines **COVID-19 confirmed case data** with the **World Happiness Report** to study the relationship between pandemic infection rates and socio-economic indicators such as **GDP per capita**, **social support**, **healthy life expectancy**, and **freedom to make life choices**.  

The analysis is performed in Python using **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**, with detailed visualizations and comparisons across countries.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
1. **Understand the spread of COVID-19**  
   - Process raw confirmed case data.  
   - Aggregate cases at the **country level**.  
   - Compute **daily infection rates** and identify the **maximum infection rate** for each country.  

2. **Combine socio-economic data with COVID-19 infection trends**  
   - Use the **World Happiness Report dataset**.  
   - Focus on key indicators: GDP per capita, Social support, Healthy life expectancy, Freedom to make life choices.  

3. **Explore relationships**  
   - Investigate correlations between infection rates and happiness indicators.  
   - Visualize patterns with scatter plots and regression lines.

## ⚙️ Data Preparation

### 🔹 COVID-19 Dataset
- Source: [Johns Hopkins University CSSE COVID-19 Dataset](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)  
- File: `covid19_Confirmed_dataset.csv`  
- Processing steps:
  - Dropped irrelevant columns (`Lat`, `Long`).  
  - Aggregated cases by **Country/Region**.  
  - Calculated **first derivative** (daily increase in cases).  
  - Extracted the **maximum daily infection rate** per country.  

Example:
```python
covid_data = pd.read_csv("Dataset/covid19_Confirmed_dataset.csv")
covid_data.drop(labels=['Lat','Long'], axis=1, inplace=True)
covid_data_aggregated = covid_data.groupby('Country/Region').sum()

# Daily infection rate
covid_data_aggregated.loc['India'].diff().plot()
````

### 🔹 World Happiness Dataset

* Source: [World Happiness Report (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness)
* File: `worldwide_happiness_report.csv`
* Processing steps:

  * Dropped columns not needed for analysis: `Overall rank`, `Score`, `Generosity`, `Perceptions of corruption`.
  * Renamed `Country or region` → `Country/Region` for consistency.
  * Merged with COVID dataset on **country name**.

Example:

```python
world_happiness_data = pd.read_csv("Dataset/worldwide_happiness_report.csv")
columns_to_drop = ['Overall rank','Score','Generosity','Perceptions of corruption']
world_happiness_data.drop(columns_to_drop, axis=1, inplace=True)
world_happiness_data.rename(columns={'Country or region':'Country/Region'}, inplace=True)

# Merge datasets
data = pd.merge(world_happiness_data, covid_data, on='Country/Region')
```

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

We compared **maximum infection rates** with socio-economic indicators:

1. **GDP per Capita vs Maximum Infection Rate**

   * Hypothesis: Countries with higher GDP may have better healthcare systems → lower infection rates.
   * Method: Scatter plot + regression line (log scale).
   * Visualization:

   ```python
   sns.scatterplot(data['GDP per capita'], np.log(data['max_infected_rates']))
   sns.regplot(data['GDP per capita'], np.log(data['max_infected_rates']))
   ```

2. **Social Support vs Maximum Infection Rate**

   * Investigated whether stronger social support networks correlated with lower infection rates.

3. **Healthy Life Expectancy vs Maximum Infection Rate**

   * Compared life expectancy with pandemic impact.

4. **Freedom to Make Life Choices vs Maximum Infection Rate**

   * Explored the role of individual freedom in pandemic response.

Each of these relationships was visualized with **Seaborn scatter plots and regression plots**.

---

## 📈 Key Insights

* The **rate of infections** varied significantly across countries, even with similar GDP.
* Countries with **higher healthy life expectancy** tended to show better resilience against maximum infection spikes.
* **Social support** had some correlation with lower infection rates, but results were mixed.
* The data suggests that socio-economic indicators influence pandemic response, but are not the sole determining factor.
